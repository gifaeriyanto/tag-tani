# Claude Code Setup Summary for Tag Tani

## What We've Set Up

You now have a fully configured Claude Code environment for the Tag Tani project that ensures consistency and clarity across all future conversations.

---

## Files Created

### 1. **CLAUDE.md** (Project Documentation)
**Location**: `/CLAUDE.md`

The main documentation file for Claude Code containing:
- Tech stack overview
- Project structure and directory layout
- Data structures and interfaces
- Code patterns and conventions
- Design system (colors, spacing, typography)
- All implemented and planned pages
- Development commands
- Quick reference links and file paths

**Why**: Automatically read by Claude Code at the start of every session to provide context about your project.

### 2. **.claude/settings.json** (Hook Configuration)
**Location**: `/.claude/settings.json`

Configures which hooks to run and when:
```json
{
  "hooks": [
    {
      "hookName": "SessionStart",
      "matcher": "*",
      "command": "node .claude/hooks/session-start.js"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Why**: Tells Claude Code to automatically run the session-start hook when a new session begins.

### 3. **.claude/hooks/session-start.js** (Clarifying Questions Hook)
**Location**: `/.claude/hooks/session-start.js`

A JavaScript hook that automatically runs at session start and:
- ‚úÖ Displays project overview and tech stack
- ‚úÖ Shows current git branch and recent commits
- ‚úÖ Asks 5 clarifying questions before you start work
- ‚úÖ Provides quick action links and key file paths
- ‚úÖ Ensures you follow existing patterns

**Why**: Helps you structure requests clearly and reminds Claude to check existing patterns.

### 4. **.claude/README.md** (Configuration Guide)
**Location**: `/.claude/README.md`

Documentation about the Claude Code configuration files:
- Explains what each file does
- How hooks work and supported events
- How to add new hooks
- Testing instructions
- Link to official documentation

**Why**: Reference guide for your configuration and future modifications.

## How It Works Now

### When You Start a New Conversation:

1. **Automatic Execution**: The SessionStart hook runs automatically
2. **Context Display**: You see:
   - Project overview (Next.js, React, Tailwind, etc.)
   - Current git status, branch, recent commits
   - 5 clarifying questions to guide your request
   - Quick links to key files and documentation
3. **You Answer**: You provide answers to the clarifying questions
4. **Claude Understands**: I automatically reference CLAUDE.md and understand:
   - Your exact requirements (no ambiguity)
   - Which existing patterns to follow
   - Consistency with current code style
   - Data structures to use

### Result:
‚úÖ Clearer, more specific requests
‚úÖ Faster implementation (no back-and-forth)
‚úÖ Consistent code with existing patterns
‚úÖ Better quality implementations

---

## What The Clarifying Questions Are

When you start a new conversation, the hook will ask:

```
1Ô∏è‚É£  WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING?
   ‚Ä¢ Which page/feature?
   ‚Ä¢ New pages, forms, or UI refinement?
   ‚Ä¢ Business requirement?

2Ô∏è‚É£  DATA & STRUCTURE
   ‚Ä¢ What fields/properties?
   ‚Ä¢ Relationships to existing data?
   ‚Ä¢ Mock data structure?
   ‚Ä¢ Interface/type definition?

3Ô∏è‚É£  UI/UX PATTERNS
   ‚Ä¢ Follow existing patterns?
   ‚Ä¢ Visualizations or charts?
   ‚Ä¢ Mobile responsive?
   ‚Ä¢ Copy from existing pages?

4Ô∏è‚É£  SCOPE & APPROACH
   ‚Ä¢ Full page or just components?
   ‚Ä¢ CRUD operations?
   ‚Ä¢ Special features (uploads, filtering)?

5Ô∏è‚É£  CONSISTENCY CHECK
   ‚Ä¢ Review CLAUDE.md
   ‚Ä¢ Check existing pages
   ‚Ä¢ Reference components
   ‚Ä¢ Use mock data patterns
```

## Next Steps

### For Your Team
1. **Commit these files** to git:
   ```bash
   git add CLAUDE.md CLAUDE-SETUP.md .claude/
   git commit -m "feat: Add Claude Code configuration"
   ```

2. **Share with team**: Let them know about the setup so they benefit from the same clarity and consistency

### For Future Development
1. **When adding new features**: Update `CLAUDE.md` with new data structures and patterns
2. **When creating new pages**: Reference existing pages (Kelompok Tani, Petani, Lahan) as templates
3. **When changing patterns**: Update CLAUDE.md to document the new patterns

### For Claude Code Sessions
Just start asking for features. The SessionStart hook will guide you through clarifying questions, and I'll automatically understand:
- Your project structure and patterns
- Design system and colors
- Component conventions
- Data structures
- File organization

---

## Advanced: Adding More Hooks

If you want to add more hooks in the future, you can:

### UserPromptSubmit Hook
Ask clarifying questions BEFORE processing (can block vague requests):
```json
{
  "hookName": "UserPromptSubmit",
  "matcher": "*",
  "command": "node .claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.js"
}
```

### PreToolUse Hook
Gate/approve tool usage before execution:
```json
{
  "hookName": "PreToolUse",
  "matcher": "Bash",
  "command": "node .claude/hooks/pre-tool-use.js"
}
```

### Stop Hook
Prevent Claude from finishing if more work is needed:
```json
{
  "hookName": "Stop",
  "matcher": "*",
  "command": "node .claude/hooks/stop.js"
}
```

See `.claude/README.md` for more details on hook types and examples.
