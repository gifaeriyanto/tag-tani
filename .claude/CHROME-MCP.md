## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Dev server must be running**
```bash
# In one terminal:
pnpm dev

# In another terminal:
claude  # Start Claude Code
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Chrome must be installed**
Chrome MCP requires Google Chrome (not Edge or Firefox)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Local development only**
Chrome MCP works with localhost URLs (like http://localhost:3000)

## If it's not working

### Check MCP is connected
```bash
/mcp
```

### Verify dev server is running
```bash
pnpm dev
# Should show: Local: http://localhost:3000
```

### Restart Claude Code
```bash
# Exit and restart Claude Code session
```

### Manually enable Chrome debugging
```bash
# macOS
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222

# Then try Chrome MCP commands again
```

## Example Workflow

```
1. You ask for a feature:

   - loading.tsx (skeleton UI)
   - KomoditiListClient.tsx (interactive)

   "Verify it looks correct"

4. Claude Code (with Chrome MCP):
   - Dev server renders page
   - Takes screenshot
   - Inspects DOM
   - Checks styling
   - Verifies layout ‚úÖ
   - Reports "Looks great!"
